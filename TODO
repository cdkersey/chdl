CHDL Near-term Roadmap
======================

_ Technology mapping
_ Create a separate header for utility functions, integer math, etc.
  - like an int log2

Possible future features:
  _ Netlist reading
  _ Pass manager
    - Is there any reason to optimize in an order other than the one used by
      the optimize function?
    - Could technology mapping be handled by this same pass manager?
  _ NodeType enumeration
    - Why? Sure enumerations can be extended but that would just lead to many
      possible integers for each enum name.
    - So we can easily pass info about node types to e.g. print them in
      different ways. Might look prettier than RTTI.
