CHDL Near-term Roadmap
======================

_ Reproduce features of rtl.cpp and assorted header files as a real library:
  . Nodes
  . Basic gates
  . Registers
  . Literals
  . Taps
  . Simulation and .vcd generation
  . Bit vectors
    . Basic support
    . Adder
    . Literals
    . Equality detection
    . Vectors of gates
    . Operators for vectors of gates, equality, etc.
  . RAM
  . 2^M-input muxes
    . Typesafe multidimensional arrays
  . The pipeline example
  . Printing of netlists
  . Dead node elimination
  . Constant folding
  . Literal reduction
  _ Redundant node elimination
  _ Keyhole optimizations

_ Pass manager
_ nodeimpls keeping track of nodes and fixing up references
_ NodeType enumeration
_ Muli-ported RAM
_ Utility programs
  - nand2c
_ Create a separate header for utility functions, integer math, etc.

. Make this work:
  bvec<32> a; bvec<4> b;
  a[range<8, 11>()] = b;

Possible future features:
  _ Netlist reading
