gCHDL Near-term Roadmap
======================

_ Add tri-state support
  _ To .nand format (including in/out ports)
    . Internal nodes
    _ in/out ports
    _ (external) .nand file reader
  _ To technology mapper and .netl format (three-state buffers are positional
    [non-commutative] 2-input gates)
    _ in/out ports for technology mapper
    . technology mapper itself
    . (external) .netl file reader

_ A directory full of simple unit tests.
  - One for each function exposed in a header file.

_ Some sort of context management.
  . As a start, add a global state reset function. chdl::reset(). This will
    enable unit tests.
  - CHDL is a stateful library. In some cases (like unit tests) it is nice to
    have multiple states which can be swapped in and out, preferably (using
    TLS) in a threadsafe manner.

_ Basic register optimization
  _ unused reg values are dead nodes
  _ reg(Lit(x)) = Lit(x)
  _ registers with the same input expressions can be combined (during common
    subexpn elim)

_ "don't care" support
  _ A "whatever" lit type; evals to 0
  _ 'template <unsigned N> bvec<N> Whatever()' utility function in lit.h
  _ optimizations: inv(whatever) = whatever, reg(whatever) = whatever
     - Treat whatevers like constant 0 or 1, based on which will reduce
       logic more (will propagate 0 to the most nand gates)
  _ eval options for simulation?

_ Create a separate header for utility functions, integer math, etc.
  - like the int log2 functions

_ Make mux use CLOG2, so input vectors don't have to involve powers of 2.
  - this will enable better optimization.

_ Fix handling of memory in vis.cpp
  - Currently the outputs are just unattached hexagons and the address nodes
    are not indicated at all.

_ Optimizations for tri-state logic
  - A tri-state node that can only be driven by one input just becomes that
    input. Its enable becomes a dangling node.
  - Any pair of inputs to a tri-state node that have the same value can be
    reduced to a single driver whose enable signal is or(e0, e1)

_ Create some documentation.
  - Make the CHDL manual more than just an imcomplete outline.

Possible future features:
  _ Change nand-based IR to industry-standard AIG (and/inverter graph)
    - This is implementation technology neutral, whereas our nand/inverter graph
      will, once optimized, not tmap to nor gates easily.
  _ Netlist reading
  _ Pass manager
    - Is there any reason to optimize in an order other than the one used by
      the optimize function?
    - Could technology mapping be handled by this same pass manager?
