Critical

  Arithmetic/logic have not been tested with non power-of-two widths.
    - Except Enc(), required by Statemachine. This one is guaranteed to work.

Must Fix

  The primary mechanism by which errors in designs are reported is by the
  program crashing. More defensive coding is needed, including design validation
  techniques. Ideally, it should be considered a bug in CHDL if optimization,
  simulation or netlist writing crashes after validation has been performed.

  Segfault/abort on exit (in library destructor),
    - g++-4.7 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.7.2-11precise2) 4.7.2; Ubuntu 12.04
    - complaint of double free
    - probably related to stale node pointers in node_dir seen by valgrind

Nuisance

  The implementation of Log2 in enc.h predates the CLOG2 macro and goes through
  great, disgusting lengths to avoid needing to take logarithms in code. This
  should be cleaned up (which would also probably make it work for non-power-of-
  two-width inputs.
