Critical

  LOG2 macro only works for powers of 2. The way to fix this is to mask out the
  least significant half before the next round, but it is difficult to do this
  in a single macro without defining any variables.

Must Fix

  The primary mechanism by which errors in designs are reported is by the
  program crashing. More defensive coding is needed, including design validation
  techniques. Ideally, it should be considered a bug in CHDL if optimization,
  simulation or netlist writing crashes after validation has been performed.

  Segfault/abort on exit (in library destructor),
    - g++-4.7 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.7.2-11precise2) 4.7.2; Ubuntu 12.04
    - complaint of double free
    - probably related to stale node pointers in node_dir seen by valgrind
