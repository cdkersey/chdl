C++ Hardware Description Language
=================================

CHDL (call it "the" CHDL at your peril) is a domain-specific language based on
C++. Specifically, it attmpts to fill the role of a "structural" hardware
description language for implementing designs.

A simple design, a full adder, implemented in CHDL, might look like the
following:

  #include <chdl/gates.h>
  #include <chdl/gateops.h>

  node FullAdder(node cout, node cin, node a, node b) {
    node h = Xor(a, b), s = Xor(h, cin);
    cout = (a && b) || (h && cin);
    return s;
  }

Adders are already provided in the CHDL library, so a device of this nature
would not be completely necessary.

NAND File Format
----------------

A very basic netlist format has been developed for storing CHDL designs for use
by other utilities. This file is called a "nand" file because all logic is
represented (currently) as a network of nand gates and inverters.

NETL File Format
----------------

The NETL file format produced by the technology mapper follows the same basic
netlist structure as the NAND file format but allows a richer set of primitives
instead of the basic NAND-inverter graph of the NAND format.

TLIB File Format
----------------

The TLIB format is used to define a technology library as a set of gates to be
matched. Each line contains the name of a gate, followed by whitespace,
followed by a description of the NAND-inverter structure that matches that
gate. This structure must be a tree in form, but leaf nodes (inputs) can be
connected.

As an example, let's write a 2-input XOR gate in TLIB format:

  xor2 inn12ni1i2

"xor2" is obviously the name of the gate. The string on the right is the
structure of the gate; a tree output in depth-first form:

            i
            |
            n
          /   \
        n       n
       / \     / \
      1   2   i   i
              |   |
              1   2
