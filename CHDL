C++ Hardware Description Library
================================

CHDL (call it "the" CHDL at your peril) is a domain-specific language based on
C++. Specifically, it attmpts to fill the role of a "structural" hardware
description language for implementing designs.

A simple design, a full adder, implemented in CHDL, might look like the
following:

  #include <chdl/gates.h>
  #include <chdl/gateops.h>

  node FullAdder(node cout, node cin, node a, node b) {
    node h = Xor(a, b), s = Xor(h, cin);
    cout = (a && b) || (h && cin);
    return s;
  }

Adders are already provided in the CHDL library, so a device of this nature
would not be completely necessary.

 Nodes
 -----

A CHDL node can be thought of as a node (also known as a net) in a digital
circuit. The chdl::node object itself is a referential type, representing an
index of a node implementation in CHDL's internal state. Using this approach,
it is ensured that assignment to a chdl::node will not only affect its sub-
sequent uses, but all prior uses as well:

  node next_x, x(Reg(next_x)),
       next_y, y(Reg(next_y)),
       next_z, z(Reg(next_z));

  next_x = Inv(x);
  next_y = Xor(x, y);
  next_z = Xor(And(x, y), z);

The downside to this is that copies performed by container objects, formerly
benign, now have the capacity to unwittingly overwrite nodes.

 Literals
 --------

A literal in CHDL is a node with a time-constant value:

  node x = Inv(Lit(0)),
       y = And(x, Lit(1));

Literals are typically used as arguments to functions:

  node val = Mux(a, Mux(b, Lit(0), Lit(1)), Lit(1));

The CHDL optimization system ensures that these are efficiently compacted, often
disappearing altogether. For example, Or(And(Lit(1), x), y).

 Gates
 -----

Internally, CHDL represents designs as a set of fundamental logic gates and
registers. The CHDL API hides the details (e.g. which gates these are) from the
user and provides the usual complement of basic logic gates:

  node x_and_y = And(x, y),
       x_nand_y = Nand(x, y),
       x_or_y = Or(x, y),
       x_nor_y = Nor(x, y),
       x_xor_y = Xor(x, y),
       x_2mux_y = Mux(z, x, y);

 Multiplexers

 Conditional Assignment
 ----------------------

The hierarchies of multiplexers needed to perform even the most basic tasks can
create opaque, difficult-to-understand code. Consider the task of implementing
an up/down counter with reset. The next value, in pseudocode would be:

  if (reset)
    ctr = 0;
  else if (count_up && !count_down)
    ctr = ctr + 1;
  else if (count_down && !count_up)
    ctr = ctr - 1;
  else
    ctr = ctr;

In the portion of CHDL covered so far, this could be implemented with multi-
plexers:

  bvec<N> ctr_next, ctr(Reg(ctr_next));
  
  ctr_next = Mux(reset,
               Mux(count_up && !count_down,
                 Mux(count_down && !count_up, ctr, ctr - Lit<N>(1)),
               ctr + Lit<N>(1)),
             Lit<N>(0));

Even with the best organization, this statement is rather hard to grok. For
these kinds of conditionals, a muliplexer with its inputs reversed would lead to
slightly easier-to-understand code:

  ctr_next = If(reset,
               Lit<N>(0),
               If(count_up && !count_down,
                 ctr + Lit<N>(1),
                 If(count_down && !count_up,
                    ctr - Lit<N>(1),
                    ctr)));

but this is only about as readable as the typical conditonal statement in LISP.
This reversed-input multiplexer is not a part of CHDL. Instead, CHDL provides
Cassign(), a conditional assignment framework. Using Cassign, this statement be-
comes:

  Cassign(ctr_next).
    IF(reset, Lit<N>(0)).
    IF(count_up && !count_down, ctr + Lit<N>(1)).
    IF(count_down && !count_up, ctr - Lit<N>(1)).
    ELSE(ctr);

One of the more powerful aspects of Cassign() is its support for nested con-
ditionals. If, say, you wanted to, in the event of a reset with one of the count
lines held high, reset to a value of +1 or -1 accordingly, this could be done
with a nested conditional:

  Cassign(ctr_next).
    IF(reset).
      IF(count_up && !count_down, Lit<N>(1)).
      IF(count_down && !count_up, Lit<N>(-1)).
      ELSE(Lit<N>(0)).
    END().
    IF(count_up && !count_down, ctr + Lit<N>(1)).
    IF(count_down && !count_up, ctr - Lit<N>(1)).
    ELSE(ctr);

File Formats
------------

 NAND File Format
 ----------------

A very basic netlist format has been developed for storing CHDL designs for use
by other utilities. This file is called a "nand" file because all logic is
represented (currently) as a network of nand gates and inverters. Each node is

 NETL File Format
 ----------------

The NETL file format produced by the technology mapper follows the same basic
netlist structure as the NAND file format but allows a richer set of primitives
instead of the basic NAND-inverter graph of the NAND format.

 TLIB File Format
 ----------------

The TLIB format is used to define a technology library as a set of gates to be
matched. Each line contains the name of a gate, followed by whitespace,
followed by a polish expression for the NAND-inverter tree that matches that
gate. This structure must be a tree in form, but leaf nodes (inputs) can
represent the same input.

As an example, let's write a 2-input XOR gate in TLIB format:

  xor2 inn12ni1i2

"xor2" is obviously the name of the gate. The string on the right is the
structure of the gate; a tree output in depth-first form:

            i
            |
            n
          /   \
        n       n
       / \     / \
      1   2   i   i
              |   |
              1   2

Frequently-Asked Questions
--------------------------

Q: I want to create a simple sequential circuit, like a counter, but my attempt:

    bvec<4> ctr1(Reg(ctr1 + Lit<4>(1))); //, or
    bvec<4> ctr2 = Reg(ctr2 + Lit<4>(1));

   does not seem to work. In fact, it behaves very strangely. What am I doing
   wrong?

A: Use two statements instead:

     bvec<4> ctr; ctr = Reg(ctr + Lit<4>(1));

   Why is this unfortunate verbosity necessary? Currently, CHDL relies on the
   bvec object "ctr" being constructed before it can be used. The reference to
   "ctr" in "ctr + Lit<4>(1)" leads to undefined behavior in C++ because ctr
   has not been constructed yet. So, while it is syntactically valid C++, it is
   semantically ambiguous.
